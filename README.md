# About ePlaces

ePlaces is a modern Web Application (powered by various APIs) written in JavaScript where users can find places to eat, drink, shop or have fun in any city around the world.

# APIs used to build the App

- [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) (main api in the project) : is one of the the best Places API that gives developers access to thousand places data around the world.
- [Ajax Autocomplete List Cities JSON-P API](http://geobytes.com/free-ajax-cities-jsonp-api/) : is one of Geobytes’ web services that gives developers access to all cities worldwide. Did I mentioned it ? **It's free**.
- [IPfy](https://www.ipify.org/) : is a simple public IP Address API that allows developers to get the user IP programmatically.
- [Geobytes](http://getcitydetails.geobytes.com/) : Locate and identify visitor by IP Address. Geobytes GetCityDetails return useful data like city_name, country_name, region_code, latitude and longitude, ...
- [HERE Maps](https://developer.here.com/documentation/maps/topics/quick-start.html) : Geolocate and display places on the map.

# Tools used in the Project

- [Parcel Bundler](https://en.parceljs.org/) : is a zero configuration bundler for web application. I've had a pleasure using it because of these features : **Zero config code splitting**, **Hot module replacement**, **Friendly error logging**, ...
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): is a JavaScript compiler that allows developer to build web application using the most recent features.

# What I have learned
